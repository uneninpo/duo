## Step 3: Optional - Download and Install Mods
 
One of the advantages of playing SimCity 5 without Origin launcher is that you can use mods to enhance your gaming experience. Mods are user-made modifications that add new features, fix bugs, improve graphics, or change gameplay aspects of the game. You can find many mods for SimCity 5 on websites like [Simtropolis](https://www.simtropolis.com/) or [SimCity 2013 Files](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/category/20-simcity-2013/).
 
To install mods for SimCity 5, you need to create a folder called "SimCityUserData" in your Documents folder. Then, create a subfolder called "Packages" inside it.

Some mod files may require additional steps or instructions, which you should read carefully before installing them.
 
After installing the mods, you can launch the game from the SimCity.exe file and enjoy playing SimCity 5 with mods.
